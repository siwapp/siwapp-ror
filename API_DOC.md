**Pagination Headers**
  * When listing invoices, the results are paginated (20 results per page), you can fetch a specific page using the `page` request parameter.
  * The `X-Pagination` header contains all pagination info.

### Searching.
It's just like listing, but adding the `q` search parameter with any of these keys:
  * `q[with_terms]=acme+inc` invoices with those terms in either name, email, identification or description in items.
  * `q[customer_id]=3` invoice whose customer has the id=3
  * `q[issue_date_gteq]=2012-01-01` invoice whose issue date is greater or equal than `2012-01-01`
  * `q[issue_date_lteq]=2012-01-01` invoice whose issue date is less or equal than `2012-01-01`
  * `q[series_id]=3` invoices whose series has the id=3
  * `q[with_status]=paid` invoices whose status is `paid` can also be `draft`, `pending` or `past_due`

Search for meta attributes can be done with:
  * `meta[key]=value`

If you wanted to search for invoices named 'acme' whose status is 'paid', you would do a GET request to

`https://siwapp-server.com/api/v1/invoices?q[with_status]=paid&q[with_terms]=acme`

### Getting all invoices from a customer

Use a conveniently nested path:

````http
GET https://siwapp-server.com/api/v1/customers/2/invoices HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Token token="abc"
````

### Show

A full representation of the invoice and its items and payments associated.
